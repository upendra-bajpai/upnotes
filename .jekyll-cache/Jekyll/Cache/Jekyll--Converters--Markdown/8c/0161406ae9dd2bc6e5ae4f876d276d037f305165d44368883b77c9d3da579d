I"û<p>Poco X3 will be launching in India on September 22 at 12pm (noon), the brand has revealed on Twitter. The Poco X3 is expected to be a slightly tweaked variant of the Poco X3 NFC that was launched in the European markets last week. While the tweet does not reveal any more details about the phone, the dedicated Flipkart teaser page shows the presence of Snapdragon 732G SoC, just like the Poco X3 NFC. As of now, it is unclear if there will be a launch event for the Poco X3 or just an announcement.</p>
