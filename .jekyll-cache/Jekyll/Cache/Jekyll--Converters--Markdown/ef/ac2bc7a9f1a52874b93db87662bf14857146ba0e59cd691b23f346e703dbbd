I"‹<p>Foldable phones are still out of the reach of most people, no thanks to their high price tags. The recently announced Moto Razr 5G launched for $1400, the Galaxy Z Flip is now $1299, and the new Galaxy Z Fold 2 is $1999. Only a handful of folks can afford to pay the aforementioned prices for a phone.</p>

<p>There are rumors that Samsung is working on an affordable Galaxy Z Fold which has been unofficially dubbed the Galaxy (Z) Fold Lite. We do not know how significantly the specs will be toned down compared to its existing models or what corners Samsung will cut to keep the price tag low. Nevertheless, we have decided to create a poll to see if folks will be willing to purchase a foldable phone with mid-range specs.</p>

<p>Yes, we know the Moto Razr 2019 and Moto Razr 5G both qualify as mid-range foldable devices but we are looking at a form factor closer to that of the Galaxy Z Fold and specs that are further toned down to make them more affordable.</p>

<p>So the full question is this â€“ Will you buy a foldable phone with the following mid-range specs for $1000?</p>

<p>Plastic/Glasstic Body</p>
