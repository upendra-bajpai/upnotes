I"è<p>An inside source quoted by GalaxyClub revealed the model number and capacity of the battery thatâ€™s going to be used for the future Galaxy S21 Ultra handset. In short - itâ€™s the same as the S20 Ultra.</p>

<p>The model number of the battery is EB-BG998ABY and itâ€™s rated at 4,885 mAh so the typical capacity will surely be 5,000 mAh - matching the Galaxy S20 Ultraâ€™s juice pack.</p>

<p>In contrast the Galaxy S21 and S21+ will get a bump in the battery capacity compared to their predecessors.</p>

<p>Of course, the improved 5nm Exynos and Snapdragon chipsets will bring some efficiency improvements so we can expect better battery life overall even though there wonâ€™t be an upgrade to the capacity.</p>
