I"5<p>PUBG Mobile update v1.0 is rolling out globally. The new major update promises a wide variety of upgrades to the game including numerous visual changes during gameplay, as well as new UI implementations. The biggest addition of them all is Erangel 2.0, which is a revamped version of the original map in the game. The new update should be available on the Google Play Store for Android users and Apple App Store for iOS users. The update size is approximately 1.8GB on Android and 2.17GB on iOS. Of course, the game is banned in India following an order by the Indian government and the popular battle royale game has been pulled down from prominent app stores. This essentially means that one cannot get the latest 1.0 update officially and it is illegal to do so.</p>

<p>We recently reported an official statement by PUBG Corp, confirming that PUBG Mobile will no longer be controlled by Tencent Games in India and that PUBC Corp will take all publishing responsibilities. This essentially means that the original South Korea-based gaming company is taking over the responsibilities, and we could see the game being unbanned in the country soon. Tencent had reportedly lost $34 billion in terms of market value, just a day after the ban on 118 Chinese apps in India.</p>
