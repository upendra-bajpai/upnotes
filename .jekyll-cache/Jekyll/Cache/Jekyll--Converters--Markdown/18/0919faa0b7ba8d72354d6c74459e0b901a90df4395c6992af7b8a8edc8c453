I"-<p>Did you know that, to date, 240 individuals from 19 countries have visited the International Space Station (ISS)? Or the fact that the ISS makes 16 orbits around the Earth every 24 hours? Or that you can look up in the sky at dawn or dusk and catch a glimpse of the space station flying past your home even if you live in a big city. The International Space Station is a symbol of human ingenuity and the aspirational goal to live beyond our own planet eventually. However, the spacecraft serves a much bigger purpose than a home for the astronauts.</p>
