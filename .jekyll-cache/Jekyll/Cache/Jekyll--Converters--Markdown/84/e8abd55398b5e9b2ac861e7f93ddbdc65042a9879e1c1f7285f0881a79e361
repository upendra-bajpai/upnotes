<p>Leaked promotional videos have revealed Facebook’s Oculus Quest 2 VR headset, which could be available as early as this week. The videos were accidentally published to Facebook Blueprint, the company’s e-learning platform, before they were taken down (via The Verge).</p>

<p>Information shared in the videos reveal the new headset will be a major upgrade over the original Oculus Quest. One of the big updates will include Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR2 platform, which was designed specifically for AR and VR hardware. In comparison, the first-gen Quest headset had Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chipset. The video also reveals the new Oculus Quest 2 will feature an “almost 4K display,” or nearly 2K per eye, 6GB of RAM (up from 4GB), and up to 256GB of storage (up from 128GB), making the headset much more powerful than the original. The new headset will also allegedly feature 3D positional audio and see the return of controller-free hand tracking.</p>

<p>What’s unclear from the new videos is whether the Oculus Quest 2 will feature a 90Hz or even 120Hz display, which Oculus had reportedly been testing; the original featured a display refresh rate of 72Hz. The video does confirm that Oculus Link support will return, allowing you to tether your Quest 2 to your PC via a USB-C cable to play PC-based VR titles on the headset.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the touch controls are expected to be upgraded to offer improved response, tracking, and haptics. The headset is described as “light” and “streamlined”, with earlier rumors suggesting the new headset will be less bulky than the original model. The video mentions the headset will have a soft-touch strap that should improve the ergonomics of slipping the headset on and off one’s head. Oculus also reportedly addressed an issue with the original Quest that caused the controller batteries to unwittingly slide out from the bottom.</p>

<p>Renders of the Oculus Quest 2 first leaked in July, revealing a VR headset that carried over a similar design to the previous version. This time, however, the USB-C port and headphone jack have seemingly been moved to the left side, with the power button being moved to the right side.</p>

<p>A previous rumor claimed the Oculus Quest 2 could launch as early as September 15. With promotional videos leaking from Facebook itself, it appears it won’t be long until we know more. Facebook has scheduled its next Oculus Connect developer conference (now called “Facebook Connect“) for September 16th, so we’ll likely see the headset unveiled then, along with its pricing and availability. A now-removed Walmart listing pegged the device’s 256GB variant at $399, for what it’s worth. If true, that’s a great price for a standalone VR headset. Potential first-time buyers of an Oculus headset should be aware, though, that they’ll need to sign up for a Facebook account in order to use the new Quest 2.</p>
