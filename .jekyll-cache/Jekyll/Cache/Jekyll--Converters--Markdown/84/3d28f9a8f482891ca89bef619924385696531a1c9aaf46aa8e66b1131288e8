I"5<p>Foldable phones are still out of the reach of most people, no thanks to their high price tags. The recently announced Moto Razr 5G launched for $1400, the Galaxy Z Flip is now $1299, and the new Galaxy Z Fold 2 is $1999. Only a handful of folks can afford to pay the aforementioned prices for a phone.</p>
