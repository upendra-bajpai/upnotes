I"*<p>WhatsApp is reportedly working on several improvements, and some of them were spotted in the code of the latest Android beta. This includes a new Catalogue Shortcut for business accounts enabling quick access to their product portfolio. There is also a new ‘Add WhatsApp Doodles’ option that is under development allowing users to make their solid wallpaper look a bit more fancy. Separately, a new ‘Call’ button is also under works. This new call button looks to slightly tweak the process of making video and voice calls inside the app.</p>
