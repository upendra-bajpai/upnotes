I"<p>SpaceX, with relatively little pomp and circumstance, carried out another successful test flight for its Starship, the company’s vehicle aimed at long-distance space flight.</p>

<p>The launch and 150-meter test flight took place on Friday in Boca Chica, Texas. The company called it a “hop” flight, since it barely went any distance at all. Everything went smoothly, however, making it the second such successful test flight. The company first pulled off a hop flight in August.</p>

<p>SpaceX released a video of the launch, short trip, and landing. The Starship’s test body looks vaguely like a massive flying water bottle — but in a weird way it makes the flight even more cool, like it’s defying the laws of physics. (A fully complete Starship would have a nose cone and landing legs.)</p>

<p>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said earlier in the summer that the Starship was at the top of the company’s to-do list. He told employees speeding progress on the long-distance spacecraft – which will one day support crewed missions to other planets – “dramatically and immediately” should be their “top priority.”</p>

<p>The massive craft is, at least in theory, supposed to be able to carry 100 passengers to the moon, Mars, or anywhere else in space.</p>

<p>SpaceX unveiled the re-usable Starship in 2019. Techcrunch called the successful hop tests a “very good sign for the spacecraft’s development program,” since other designs have never even reached this point. So it’s two short tests down, but still a long way to go until Mars.</p>
