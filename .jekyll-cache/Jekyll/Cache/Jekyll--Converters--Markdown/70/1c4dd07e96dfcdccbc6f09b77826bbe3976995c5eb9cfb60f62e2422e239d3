I"Þ<p>Huaweiâ€™s latest phone features a pop-up selfie camera and a 6.63-inch LCD display with 92% screen-to-body ratio.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it doesnâ€™t look like Huawei plans to sell the phone in many places outside the Middle East and Central and Pacific Asia.</p>

<p>Back when images of the Mate 30 series first started making their way online, it seemed like Huawei planned to release a Lite variant of the phone. Huawei never ended up announcing that device, but the company just revealed what is effectively a Mate 30 Lite by another name. The only problem is youâ€™ll have trouble getting ahold of the Huawei Y9a if you live outside of the handful of markets where the company plans to sell the device. So far, weâ€™ve only seen that itâ€™s coming to Iraq where it will cost $239.</p>

<p>Limited availability aside, the Y9a looks like it could be a decent mid-range option. The phone features a MediaTek Helio G80 processor and a 6.63-inch LCD display with 2,400 x 1,080 resolution. The highlight of the Y9a is a 16MP pop-up selfie camera that helps give the phone a 92% screen-to-body ratio. For all other photos, thereâ€™s a 64MP primary camera complimented by a 2MP depth sensor and 8MP ultrawide and 2MP macro cameras.</p>

<p>In Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and some countries in Central Asia, the company will sell a model of the Y9a that features 8GB of RAM, a 4,200mAh battery, and 40W fast charging support. Outside of those markets, the Y9a will feature 6GB of RAM and a 4,300mAh with 22.5W charging support. According to Huawei, the 40W adapter can charge the Y9a to 70% battery in approximately 30 minutes. Both variants will feature 128GB of expandable storage with Huaweiâ€™s EMUI 10.1 coming preinstalled on the phone.</p>

<p>Like most of Huaweiâ€™s recent phones, the Y9a wonâ€™t come with Google Play, forcing those who buy the phone to get their apps from Huaweiâ€™s AppGallery store.</p>

<p>Rounding out the Y9a feature list is a side-mounted fingerprint sensor and a 3.5mm headphone jack. At launch, Huawei plans to sell the phone in three colors: Space Silver, Sakura Pink, and Midnight Black. If Huawei decides to release the Y9a in more markets, weâ€™ll let you know.</p>
