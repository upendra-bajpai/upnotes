I"ﬂ<p>Data gathered by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)‚Äôs Chandrayaan-1 orbiter says that the Moon may be experiencing rusting along its polar areas owing to the fact that haematite-like material has been found to be present there. This is an interesting development because rust forms on metals when they are exposed to water and oxygen. While it comes as one more confirmation of the presence of water on the surface of our natural satellite, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) also believes that the Earth may have had a role to play in the development of this rust.</p>

<p>Union Minister Jitendra Singh said regarding the matter, ‚ÄúISRO‚Äôs maiden mission to the Moon has sent images which show that the Moon may be rusting along the poles. The sign of this finding is that even though the surface of the Moon is known to have iron-rich rocks, it is not known for the presence of water and oxygen, which are the two elements needed to interact with iron to create rust.‚Äù Meanwhile, scientists from NASA have asserted that the earth‚Äôs oxygen very well had a role to play in the formation of this rust since hematite normally requires both oxygen and water.</p>
