I"‚<p>Specialists have anticipated that by 2100, 558 mammal species may get extinct if preservation endeavors are not improved. â€˜On the basis of the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature)-based scenario, we predict 558 mammal speciesâ€™ extinctions globally by the year 2100,â€™ the study authors wrote. Further the authors said, â€˜We are losing biodiversity every year, and with every extinct species and population, we lose unique evolutionary history.â€™ Currently there are 5,700 surviving types of well evolved mammals. In the previous 126,000 years in any event 351 warm blooded animal species have become wiped out.</p>
