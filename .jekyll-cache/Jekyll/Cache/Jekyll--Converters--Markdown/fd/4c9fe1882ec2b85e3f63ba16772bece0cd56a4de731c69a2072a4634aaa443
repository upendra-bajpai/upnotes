I"I<p>Xiaomi will launch the first Redmi smart band in India today. The smart fitness band has been teased by Xiaomi revealing some features of the fitness band. Xiaomi also launched the first Redmi Band earlier this year in China. So it’s most likely that this is the Redmi Smart Band coming to India.</p>

<p>The Redmi Smart Band launch is scheduled to take place at 12 noon later today. Xiaomi hasn’t shared any live streaming link for the launch so it will probably be just an announcement. There’s a “notify me” button on the Redmi Smart Band’s teaser page to get updates on the launch. Based on its teasers, the Redmi Smart Band will come with 24/7 heart rate monitoring, a 14-day battery life, step counter, and 5 ATM waterproof.</p>

<p>This will most likely be another affordable fitness band from Xiaomi. In China, the Redmi Band is priced at CNY 99 which translates to roughly ₹1,100. The Redmi Band looks quite different from the Mi Band 4. It has a rectangular shaped display which is a 1.08-inch AMOLED colour display. There’s a menu button at the bottom to navigate on the fitness band.</p>

<p>The Redmi Band has features such as heart rate monitoring, sleep monitoring, and five sports modes. It has a battery life of 14 days, and it also comes with idle alerts like the Mi Band 4. The Redmi Band also comes with more than 70 dial faces that the user can choose from. It has four colour options of green, black, blue and red.</p>

<p>If it is the Redmi Band launching in India, then the key differentiator would be the design of the fitness band as compared to the Mi Bands.</p>
