I"Ø<p>Jupiter could now be facing some of its own global warming issues. It turns out that Jupiterâ€™s moons could be warming each other, in what is known as a process called tidal heating. This where Jupiter and its moons interact with each other during gravitational tugs which sees the planet and the moon exert pressure in either direction. Till now, it was believed that the planet itself was responsible for the tidal heating process, but the newest research indicates that moon to moon interactions are responsible for the heating up. The new study published in the Geophysical Research Letters suggest that some of Jupiterâ€™s otherwise icy moons contain interiors warm enough to host oceans, which means liquid water.</p>
