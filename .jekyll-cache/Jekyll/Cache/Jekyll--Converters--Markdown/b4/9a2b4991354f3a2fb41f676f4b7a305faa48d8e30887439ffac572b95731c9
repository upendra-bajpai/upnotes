I"X<p>Data gathered by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)â€™s Chandrayaan-1 orbiter says that the Moon may be experiencing rusting along its polar areas owing to the fact that haematite-like material has been found to be present there. This is an interesting development because rust forms on metals when they are exposed to water and oxygen. While it comes as one more confirmation of the presence of water on the surface of our natural satellite, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) also believes that the Earth may have had a role to play in the development of this rust.</p>
