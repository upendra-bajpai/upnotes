I"ê<p>Samsung made waves roughly a month ago when it announced that it would offer three years of Android version updates to a variety of its devices. The Korean brand says it‚Äôll offer three years of major version updates to the Galaxy S10 and up, the Galaxy Note 10 and higher, and several more devices.</p>

<p>In fact, even the budget-focused Galaxy A series is getting in on the update action too, down to the mid-range Galaxy A51. So it got us wondering whether this pledge alone would be enough for customers to actually want to buy Samsung phones.</p>

<p>Results</p>

<p>The poll was published on August 22, drawing in 6,730 votes. And the results are overwhelmingly positive for the Korean brand. Almost 94% of readers said they‚Äôd buy a Samsung device due to this new approach to updates. Just over 6% of people voted in the negative, saying they don‚Äôt care about the new policy.</p>

<p>We can‚Äôt say we‚Äôre surprised by this result at all, as a previous Android Authority poll found that roughly 96% of respondents wanted Android updates for three to five years. Furthermore, another Android Authority poll found that ~85% of readers wouldn‚Äôt consider a phone if it didn‚Äôt get a single major Android update.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs clear then that Android version updates are extremely important to our readers, as you‚Äôd expect. But will this update policy result in increased sales for Samsung? We‚Äôll just have to wait and see.</p>

<p>Your comments</p>

<p>daftrok : It is a step in the right direction but to me security updates are more important than OS updates. 3 years OS and 4-5 years security would be ideal.</p>

<p>Adrian B√∂nde: 3 years is not solving any issue.. it should be much longer. Apple has 5 years which should be the minimum for every smartphone! The hardware is capable of bringing more years of compatibility with the newest software releases and at these smartphone prices the companies should show responsibility by letting these phones live as long as possible!</p>

<p>Jeshurun Kandy: I don‚Äôt really care about is updates from the manufacturer all that much as I‚Äôd much rather flash a custom ROM, with basically eternal updates especially for popular devices. ‚Äì from my Galaxy Note 3 running Android 10</p>

<p>anonymous 42: This is great, i was already considering saving up and buying the Samsung A51 because it‚Äôs a great phone. And it‚Äôs good to know if i do get the phone, i would not only be getting a phone that‚Äôs have Android 10 and still getting Android updates but 3 of them. That‚Äôs mean i can get Android 13 when it‚Äôs comes, that‚Äôs more than even flagships. Another reason for me to try and save up for the A51.</p>

<p>MM_Rafez : I would trade off 1 android version update with 2 years of additional security updates.</p>

<p>D9: Good on Samsung. I can keep one of their phones for a couple of years and then pass it on to a relative or friend with some life left in it as far as software support goes.</p>
