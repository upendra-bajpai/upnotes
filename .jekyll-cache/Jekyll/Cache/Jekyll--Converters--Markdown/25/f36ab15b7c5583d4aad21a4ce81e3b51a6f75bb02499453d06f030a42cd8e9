<p>The company tweeted ‚Äú proudly announces the animal study results of Covaxin‚Äì-these results demonstrate the protective efficacy in a live viral challenge model.‚Äù</p>

<p>Bharat Biotech noted on its website that the vaccine was given (as a two dose vaccination regimen) to 20 rhesus macaques who were divided into four groups. One group was given placebo, while three groups were immunised with three different vaccine candidates at zero and 14-days. ‚ÄúAll the macaques were exposed to viral challenge 14 days after the second dose,‚Äù the company said.</p>

<p>The results showed protective efficacy, increasing Sars-CoV-2 specific IgG and neutralising antibodies reducing the replication of the virus in the nasal cavity, throat and lung tissues of the monkeys. Bharat Biotech also noted that no evidence of pneumonia was observed in the vaccinated groups unlike the placebo group. ‚ÄúAdverse events were not seen in animals immunized with a two-dose vaccination regimen,‚Äù it added.</p>
