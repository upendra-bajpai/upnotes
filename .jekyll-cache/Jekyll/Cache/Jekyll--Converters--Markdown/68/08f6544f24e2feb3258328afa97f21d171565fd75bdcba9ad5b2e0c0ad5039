I"l	<p>The Tecno Spark Power 2 launched in India in late June, a INR 10,000 phone with a massive 7.0” display and an equally massive 6,000 mAh battery. But if you want a slightly more affordable option with most of the same specs, then the new Spark Power 2 Air may be for you.</p>

<p>The sizable 7.0” display covers more than 90% of the front of the device. The resolution is on the low side, 720p+, but that will work just fine with Netflix’s HD plan (INR 350/month). The phone packs stereo speakers to enhance the viewing experience to boot.</p>

<p>Tecno Spark Power 2 Air: 7.0” 720+ display (up to 480 nits of brightness) • 6,000 mAh battery</p>

<p>The 6,000 mAh battery should last 15 hours of video playback according to official numbers. Or 13 hours of playing a game, if you prefer. There’s no word on charging speed, but Tecno does touts an AI-powered battery care feature.</p>

<p>Above the display is an 8MP camera inside a teardrop notch. It’s paired with a dual LED flash for late night selfies. The back technically houses a quad camera, though only the 13 MP main cam (f/1.8 lens aperture) is of note – it’s joined by 2 MP macro and depth modules, plus an “AI lens”, whatever that is. At least the quad LED promises bright illumination for night time photos.</p>

<p>Tecno Spark Power 2 Air</p>

<p>The Tecno Spark Power 2 Air is equipped with a MediaTek Helio A22 chipset (four A53 cores at 2.0 GHz, PowerVR GE6320 GPU), running Android 10 skinned with HiOS 6.1 (note: full fat Android this time, not Android Go). RAM capacity is 3GB while storage starts at 32GB (it can be expanded with a microSD card).</p>

<p>This is a dual SIM phone, its card slot can accept two nano-SIMs and one microSD (up to 256 GB). Dual LTE and VoLTE are supported, additional connectivity includes Wi-Fi 5 (ac) and Bluetooth 5.0.</p>

<p>The Tecno Spark Power 2 Air will go on sale on September 20 at noon. You will find it on Flipkart, which already has a landing page set up. The price is INR 8,500 ($115) or 15% cheaper than the Power 2. You will be able to choose between Cosmic Shine and Ice Jadeite colors.</p>

<p>Do have a look at the Power 2, though. It’s only slightly pricier than the Air and has the same the screen and battery. However, it offers an octa-core processor, a better GPU and more memory, plus there’s a 5MP ultra wide camera on the back. Here it is on Flipkart.</p>
