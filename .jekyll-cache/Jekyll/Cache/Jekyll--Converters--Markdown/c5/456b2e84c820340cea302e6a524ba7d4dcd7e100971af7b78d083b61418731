<p>First air purification solution to test COVID-19, achieving a 99.4% reduction of the surface strain within 30 minutes</p>

<p>BENGALURU, India, Sept. 15, 2020 /PRNewswire/ – Global Plasma Solutions (GPS), the leader in Indoor Air Quality, has announced industry-leading ionization testing results, demonstrating a 99.4% reduction rate on a SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) surface strain within 30 minutes, the first instance in which an air purification company has effectively neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Following initial testing of coronavirus 229E in March 2020, Global Plasma Solutions utilized its proprietary needlepoint needlepoints bipolar ionization to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. The study was jointly executed with Aviation Clean Air. GPS’ NPBI technology works to safely clean the air inside commercial as well as residential buildings.</p>

<p>Speaking about the technology, Mr. Boban Varghese, MD Aircare Engineering shared, “Our proven technology delivers clean indoor air that is safe and healthy - producing neither ozone nor other harmful by-products. Through NPBI, our products purify the air by eliminating airborne particulates, odors and pathogens- most relevant in today’s Post Covid scenario. The combined effect is a lowered carbon footprint for your facility and up to 30% energy savings through a reduced (up to 75%) outdoor air intake.”</p>

<p>In the laboratory, a test was conducted to mimic ionization conditions like that of a commercial aircraft’s fuselage. Based on viral titrations, it was determined that at 10 minutes, 84.2% of the virus was inactivated. At 15 minutes, 92.6% of the virus was inactivated, and at 30 minutes, 99.4% of the virus was inactivated.</p>

<p>“For any kind of facility from hospitals, offices, commercial buildings to aircrafts, delivering the cleanest, safest indoor air environment will only become increasingly more important, and our ozone-free technology is one of the most sophisticated products on the market,” added Mr. Boban Varghese - Aircare Engineering.</p>

<p>Understanding Needlepoint Bipolar ionization</p>

<p>Needlepoint bipolar ionization works to safely clean indoor air, leveraging an electronic charge to create a high concentration of positive and negative ions. These ions travel through the air continuously seeking out and attaching to particles. This sets in motion a continuous pattern of particle combination. As these particles become larger, they are eliminated from the air more rapidly.</p>

<p>Additionally, positive and negative ions have microbicidal effects on pathogens, ultimately reducing the infectivity of the virus. GPS’ needlepoint bipolar ionization is ozone-free and the only kind in its category to pass the RCTA DO-160 standard for aircraft. Traditional bipolar ionization systems produce harmful ozone as a byproduct.</p>
