<p>A boy, 9, is facing an ‘agonising’ wait to see if he has contracted HIV after he pricked his finger on a dirty needle during a day out at the beach.</p>

<p>Clayton Spiller buried his hand in the sand at Boscombe, near Bournemouth, and was stabbed by the syringe.</p>

<p>Dad, Dan Spiller, said his son was taken to hospital to have tests done to see if the needle was contaminated and it’ll be eight weeks until they get the results.</p>

<p>He said a beach ranger was no help at all and didn’t even know where the first aid kit was. A lifeguard came to the rescue and helped clean up the wound with anti-septic wipes.</p>

<p>Mr Spiller told the Bournemouth Echo: ‘Now we have got eight weeks of worrying “has he got HIV”. They were trying to reassure us the chances are low.</p>

<p>‘Because he is under-18 he had injections for hepatitis B and D, we’ll go back in three months for another one.</p>

<p>‘My other two kids were worried sick for their older brother. I am just cross, upset and disappointed. At this point we still have to wait to see if he has HIV.’</p>

<p>The National AIDS Trust has sought to reassure the family that the risk of Clayton contracting HIV from an incident like this is incredibly low.</p>

<p>Its director of policy, Kat Smithson, told Metro.co.uk: ‘Although pricking your finger on a discarded needle would undoubtedly be distressing and does have some health risks – the risk of catching HIV is virtually non-existent.</p>

<p>‘There has never been a recorded case anywhere in the world of someone being infected with HIV through a needle injury in a public place. HIV is a very fragile virus that lives outside the body only for a matter of moments.’</p>

<p>The Spiller family, who live in Bournemouth and are frequent visitors to the beach, say they were ‘gobsmacked’ at how the situation was handled by the beach ranger.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council denied that anyone from its seafront team had been involved.</p>

<p>Boscombe beach has been a popular destination for many during the summer. Thousands of tourists flocked to the Bournemouth area during the heatwave at the start of August as coronavirus lockdown restrictions eased.</p>

<p>Locals have frequently complained about the amount of litter left behind by day-trippers and high levels of anti-social behaviour.</p>

<p>An RNLI spokesman told the Echo: ‘Our lifeguards undergo demanding training to prepare them for the many situations they may face on the beach.</p>

<p>‘Water rescues are only one area of their work and they deal with many aspects of casualty care, offering first aid and safety advice to anyone who needs their help. Our lifeguards work hard to ensure that everyone who visits the beach is able to return home safely.’</p>
