I"∫<p>NASA says the wildfires burning on the US West Coast are sending carbon monixide high into the atmosphere, with concentrations at least seven times the normal amount.</p>

<p>NASA released animation based on data sent by its Atmospheric Infrared Sounder aboard the Aqua satellite, which captured the plumes coming from California‚Äôs wildfires.</p>

<p>The animation shows the three-day averages of carbon monoxide concentrations around three miles (five kilometers) up in the atmosphere between 6-14 September.</p>

<p>Red and orange areas indicate regions with concentrations of greater than 350 parts per billion by volume (ppbv), which NASA described as ‚Äúextremely high‚Äù.</p>

<p>The more normal, background concentrations of carbon monoxide show up as yellow and green, with amounts between 30 and 50 ppbv.</p>

<p>NASA explained that at the altitude mapped, carbon monoxide has little effect on the air we breathe.</p>

<p>But strong winds can push the gas downwards where it can affect air quality and play a part in climate change.</p>

<p>The wildfires in California have burned about 5,000 square miles (12,950 square kilometers), destroyed 4,200 structures and killed at least 24 people.</p>
