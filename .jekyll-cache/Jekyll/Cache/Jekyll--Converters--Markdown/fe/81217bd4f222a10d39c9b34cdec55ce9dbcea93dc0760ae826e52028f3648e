I"º<p>The aim of the programme is for China to acquire the basic technologies of unmanned lunar exploration with limited investment, Pei said.</p>

<p>China is drawing up plans for future lunar exploration. To pave the way for manned lunar exploration and deep space exploration, the Chang‚Äôe-5 mission will use a sampling method different from those of the United States and the Soviet Union, Pei said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúUnmanned rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit will be a historic first. It will be very difficult,‚Äù said Peng Jing, deputy chief designer of the Chang‚Äôe-5 probe from the China Academy of Space Technology under the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe could call it a milestone mission. Its success will help us acquire the basic capabilities for future deep space exploration such as sampling and take-off from Mars, asteroids and other celestial bodies,‚Äù Peng was quoted by Xinhua.</p>

<p>The scientific goals of the Chang‚Äôe-5 mission include the investigation of the landing area to obtain the on-site analysis data related to the lunar samples, as well as systematic and long-term laboratory analysis of the lunar samples.</p>

<p>The landing site of Chang‚Äôe-5 will be to the west of that of Chang‚Äôe-3, which went to the moon in 2013.</p>

<p>This site is chosen because the region has a young geological age, younger than the sampling areas of the United States and the Soviet Union 40 years ago. This region has never been sampled. The new samples will be of great scientific value, Chinese experts said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDomestic and overseas scientists will all have a chance to get the lunar samples to be brought back by Chang‚Äôe-5 for research,‚Äù Pei added.</p>
