<ul>
  <li>Size of an array is number of elements multiplied by the type of element, that is why we get sizeof arri as 12 and sizeof arrc as 3. Size of a pointer is fixed for a compiler. All pointer types take same number of bytes for a compiler. That is why we get 4 for both ptri and ptrc.</li>
</ul>
