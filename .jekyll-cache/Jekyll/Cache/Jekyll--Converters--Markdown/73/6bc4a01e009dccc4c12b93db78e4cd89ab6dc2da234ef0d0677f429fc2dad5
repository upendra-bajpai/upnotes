I"æ<p>Hydrogen, the simplest and most abundant element in the Universe, develops a remarkably complex behavior upon compression. Since Wigner predicted the dissociation and metallization of solid Hydrogen at megabar pressures almost a century ago, several efforts have been made to explain the many unusual properties of dense Hydrogen, including a rich and poorly understood substantial polymorphism, an anomalous melting line, and the possible transition to a superconducting state.</p>
