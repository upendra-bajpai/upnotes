I"r<p>Spider-Man: Miles Morales gameplay trailer has swung in. At the PlayStation 5 Showcase event, Sony Interactive Entertainment unveiled seven minutes of first look gameplay from the first Spider-Man PS5 game centred on the Harlem hero. It starts off with Miles attending a political rally organised by his mother, which goes sideways after some criminals barge in, forcing Milesâ€™ alter ego to step in. The fight takes him to a nearby bridge, where he squares up with some neon-sporting villains rocking some solid gear of their own. Miles replies with the use of his invisibility powers and his own arsenal of attacks.</p>
