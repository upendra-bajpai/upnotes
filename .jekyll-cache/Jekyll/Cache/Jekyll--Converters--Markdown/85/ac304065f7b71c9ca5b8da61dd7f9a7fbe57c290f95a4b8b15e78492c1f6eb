I"Æ<p>Scientists say buildings on Mars could be made from a substance found in fish scales and fungi called chitin.</p>

<p>Chitin is one of the most ubiquitous organic polymers on Earth, and when mixed with Martian soil, it could make a sturdy enough material to build tools and shelters.</p>

<p>The organic polymer could be sourced on Mars from the bio-conversion of organic waste by insects or fungi â€“ which could be grown on farms.</p>

<p>In preliminary tests of the material, the experts have constructed a wrench and a mini model of a Martian habitat with the resilience of plastics.</p>

<p>Chitin could help NASA and private companies such as Elon Muskâ€™s SpaceX, which plan to establish human colonies on Mars in the next 20 years.</p>

<p>Researchers from Singapore University of Technology and Design used the chitin to construct a wrench and a model of a Martian habitat</p>

<p>â€˜Bioinspired manufacturing and sustainable materials are not a substituting technology for synthetic polymers, but an enabling technology defining a new paradigm in manufacturing,â€™ said study author Dr Javier Fernandez at Singapore University of Technology and Design.</p>

<p>â€˜We have demonstrated that they are key not only for our sustainability on Earth but also for one of the next biggest achievements of humanity â€“ our transformation into an interplanetary species.â€™</p>

<p>Chitin is produced and metabolized by organisms across most biological kingdoms.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a primary component of cell walls in fungi, the exoskeletons of arthropods, such as crustaceans and insects, and the scales of fish and amphibians.</p>

<p>Chitin is the second most abundant organic polymer on Earth after cellulose and is â€˜biologyâ€™s recurrent solution to forming structural componentsâ€™, the experts say.</p>

<p>In bio-manufacturing, itâ€™s already used in food manufacturing to develop edible films and as a thickener.</p>

<p>The researchersâ€™ technique, detailed in PLOS ONE, involves combining chitin with a mineral designed to mimic Martian soil, which is known as regolith.</p>

<p>Molded samples of varying geometry intricacies to demonstrate the materialâ€™s ability to replicate objects</p>

<p>On Mars, the rocky deposits could be placed in a chitin solution with water, sourced from melted ice.</p>

<p>After the evaporation of the water, the chitosan crystallizes, reduces in volume and pulls the regolith particles together.</p>

<p>Chitin can form transparent objects similar in appearance and characteristics to plastics produced to a high volume on Earth.</p>

<p>The material requires little energy and no specialised equipment to produce and could form homes and shelters, which would offer protection from intense solar radiation on the Red Plant.</p>

<p>â€˜The technology was originally developed to create circular ecosystems in urban environments, but due to its efficiency, it is also the most efficient and scalable method to produce materials in a closed artificial ecosystem in the extremely scarce environment of a lifeless planet or satellite,â€™ said Dr Fernandez.</p>

<p>In terms of where the chitin would actually come from, astronauts could rely on their stock of insects that would already potentially be providing them with food.</p>

<p>A custom-designed wrench was also created by the experts, who say chitin will likely be part of any artificial ecosystem</p>

<p>Insects farms could not only fulfil the caloric requirements of the Mars dwellers but offer a constant supply of chitin.</p>

<p>Such critical technologies must be decided quickly, considering NASA wants to revisit the Moon by the late 2020s and take a crewed mission to Mars by the late 2030s.</p>

<p>SpaceX is also planning to send two unmanned cargo ships to Mars as soon as 2022 to set up support infrastructure and water mining systems there.</p>

<p>The first crewed Mars mission could then follow as early as 2024 if development and testing go well, Musk has said.</p>

<p>Shuttling humans to Mars is all part of the $23.6-billion-CEOâ€™s belief that space travel is the only way to save humanity from extinction.</p>

<p>His highly entertaining research paper published in New Space, entitled â€˜Making Humans a Multi-Planetary Speciesâ€™, outlines the companyâ€™s vision.</p>
