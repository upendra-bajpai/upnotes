<p>Why Do People Fast On This Day?</p>

<p>Promoted</p>

<p>Eclipses have inspired great awe among people since time immemorial. As we know now, heavenly bodies are always moving but long back, when there were not many known sources of light, people depended on these celestial bodies and planned their day accordingly; so when these bodies became a shade darker due to their movements, it was seen as an aberration. People stalled their movements and also give up on food through the duration of the lunar eclipse. It was considered that all food could get contaminated during this phase due to the absence of light. Not just India, many tribes across the world have had their own set of rituals associated with eclipse. Scientists in recent times have dispelled all these theories, and encourage people to carry on with their regular activities during the time. It is, however, not recommended to watch the eclipse with naked eyes. Many people also feel anxious during the time, for them, it is a good idea to meditate, as per Yoga experts.</p>

<p>Along with sky gazers, many other people are also eagerly awaiting for Monday, as Kartik Purnima and Guru Nanak Jayanti also fall on the same day.</p>
