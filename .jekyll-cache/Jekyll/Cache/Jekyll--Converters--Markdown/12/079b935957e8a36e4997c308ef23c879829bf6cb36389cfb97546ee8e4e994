<p>The Journey to 10k</p>

<p>Aventador debuted in 2011 as the LP 700-4 coupe. Its carbon fiber monocoque is a single shell that combines the cockpit, floor and roof in a single structure for high structural rigidity. This further accentuates performance dynamism, and passive safety.</p>

<p>Aventador LP 700-4 V12 engine returns 700 HP (515 kW) of power at 8,250 rpm. Acceleration was pegged at 2.9 seconds for a 0 to 100 km/h sprint, and top speed at 350 km/h. ISR robotized transmission makes for ultra-fast shifts, and its push-rod suspension system enhances driving precision.</p>

<p>In November of 2012, the Aventador Roadster was introduced. Its two section carbon fibre roof, and composite and tech provisions made for a lightweight. Each section of the roof weighs less than 6 kg. A redesigned rear pillar supports the removable roof.</p>

<p>Aventador J open super sports car dispensed both, roof and classic windscreen, and was shown at 2012 Geneva Motor Show. The 700 HP (515 kW) two-seater is a loaded showcase of tech solutions and materials that keep carbon fiber tech at its core. Approved for road use, itâ€™s a one-off unit.</p>

<p>In 2016, Aventador Miura Homage special series was introduced on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. Limited to 50 units, Aventador Miura Homage reflects the original Miura models.</p>

<p>Lamborghini Aventador S</p>

<p>The same year, Lamborghini Aventador S was introduced with a new aerodynamic design, redesigned suspension, more power, and renewed driving dynamics. Aventador S sports a 6.5 litre 12-cyl aspirated engine with an output of 740 HP. The 4WD features a new active suspension, four-wheel steering system, and EGO driving mode for additional configuration profiles for further customisation in terms of traction, steering, and suspension in Strada, Sport and Corsa settings.</p>

<p>Aventador SVJ (SV stands for Superveloce, andJ for Jota) was introduced in 2018. Itâ€™s the fastest production vehicle thatâ€™s run through the NÃ¼rburgring-Nordschleife track, going 20.6 km lap in 6:44.97 minutes. Production is limited to 900 units.</p>

<p>SVJ 63 special edition is limited to 63 units with special setup highlights and extensive use of carbon fiber. SVJ editions feature aerodynamically-oriented design inputs. A disconnected front splitter acts as an airflow channel. A three-dimensional air intake on the hood directs airflow. The rear spoiler is designed for best aerodynamic efficiency. Front bumper with integrated side fins features a new air intake and the ALA system (Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva).</p>

<p>In 2019, a special Aventador S by Skyler Grey, limited to just the one unit, was unveiled. As with the legend of Lamborghini, one can always look forward to a special edition Aventador to celebrate a time gone by, or bring together a future that resonates.</p>
