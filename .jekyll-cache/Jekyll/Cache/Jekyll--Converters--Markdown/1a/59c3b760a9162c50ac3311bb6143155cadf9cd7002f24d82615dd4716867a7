I"R<p>Many people get into the habit of daily drinking only because they feel it helps them relieve stress. Though yes, alcohol may temporarily relieve some stress, it should not become a habit. Alcohol is actually a depressant that can increase anxiety. Choose herbal tea over alcohol. It has been observed that tea drinkers have a lower level of cortisol, the stress hormone. Herbal teas are caffeine-free. Caffeine can trigger anxiety and interfere with sleep. So, a cup of herbal tea might not look as great as a glass of wine but it surely will make you feel better if you are stressed.</p>
