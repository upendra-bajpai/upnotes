<p>If you look up in the night sky this week, you may notice a mysterious trail of lights flying above you.</p>

<p>But before you worry about an impending alien invasion, thankfully there’s a simple explanation for the satellites - they’re SpaceX ’s Starlink satellites!</p>

<p>The satellites are released every two weeks or so, and are designed to deliver high speed broadband internet to remote areas around the world.</p>

<p>SpaceX explained: “With performance that far surpasses that of traditional satellite internet, and a global network unbounded by ground infrastructure limitations, Starlink will deliver high speed broadband internet to locations where access has been unreliable, expensive, or completely unavailable.”</p>

<p>So far, SpaceX has launched over 600 Starlink satellites, but has plans to launch a total of nearly 12,000 satellites into orbit.</p>

<p>While most satellites orbit at a height of around 1,000km above Earth, the Starlink satellites orbit at a lower heigh of around 550km, meaning they’re regularly visible.</p>

<p>This week, eagle-eyed Brits will have two opportunities to spot the Starlink satellites themselves.</p>
