I"¤<p>Samsung had first deployed the September 2020 security patch last week, with the Galaxy Note 9 being the first device in its portfolio to receive it. A handful of other devices have followed suit, including the Galaxy Note 10 Lite which also received One UI 2.5. As the rollout continues to expand, the company has now briefly turned its attention towards one of its older S Pen models, namely the Galaxy Note 8.</p>
