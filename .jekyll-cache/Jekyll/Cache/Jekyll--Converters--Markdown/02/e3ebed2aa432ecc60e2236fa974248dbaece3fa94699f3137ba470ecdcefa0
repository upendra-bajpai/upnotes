I"÷<p>What are the parameters to measure social progress? Most nations go by GDP growth, but are economic indicators enough? Not quite, according to the United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Solutions Network. The agency has been rolling out the World Happiness Report since 2012. This survey measures the well-being and progress of nations, but with a difference â€“ namely, how happy are its citizens?</p>

<p>Denmark was the happiest country among 157 others in this yearâ€™s survey and has retained its spot in the top 10 since 2013.</p>

<p>But Indians are not so happy. We rank 118, in fact we toppled down a position. However, our Asian neighbours seem to be faring much better â€“ China is at 83, Pakistan is at 92 and even Bangladesh is at 110.</p>
