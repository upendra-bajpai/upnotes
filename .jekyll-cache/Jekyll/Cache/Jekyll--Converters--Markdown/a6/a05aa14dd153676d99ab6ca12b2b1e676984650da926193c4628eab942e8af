<p>Xiaomi has been sending out MIUI 12 updates for well over three months at this point. In that period, the company has rolled out MIUI 12 to most of its premium phones, including the previously-ignored Mi Mix 3 5G. For some reason, however, the Redmi Note 8 and Redmi Note 9 Pro series remain on MIUI 11. But not for much longer.</p>

<p>Just last week, Xiaomi finally rolled the credits on the second phase of its MIUI 12 rollout. The second phase of the rollout saw updates sent out to phones like the Mi Mix 2, Redmi Note 9, and Redmi Note 7. The company has now entered the third phase, and going by previous information, should see devices like the Mi Max 3, Mi CC9e, and Mi Note 3 get the update. Even more importantly, the update should finally arrive for the Redmi Note 8.</p>
