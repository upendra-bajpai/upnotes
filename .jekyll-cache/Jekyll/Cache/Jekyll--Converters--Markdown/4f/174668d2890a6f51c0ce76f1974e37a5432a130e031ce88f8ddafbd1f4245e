I"<p>Xiaomi is known for various products apart from smartphones. Its smart TV business is one of the largest in China and India. Since the beginning of this year, the company has been making breakthroughs in this segment with products like Redmi Smart TV MAX 98 and Mi TV LUX OLED Transparent Edition. Late last month, an 82-inch Xiaomi 8K and 4K televisions were spotted on 3C. Now, more information about the 8K model emerges.</p>

<p>The upcoming 82-inch Mi TV 8K (7680 x 4320 pixels) will bear the model number L82M6-8K, as per 3C. It is listed on the Chinese certification bureau with a power rating of 100-240V~, 50/60Hz, 700W.</p>

<p>Additionally, Digital Chat Station, the one who shared this listing first claimed it to use panels from LG Display. However, he did not mention the type of the panel. The new information about this television also comes from him but even now, he did not say anything about the type of the panel but revealed something more interesting about his forthcoming TV.</p>

<p>According to the tipster, the soon to be launched Mi TV 82-inch 8K will come with an integrated 5G modem to provide an uninterrupted 8K streaming experience. He also says that this television will be super expensive but will be cheaper than the companyâ€™s 49,999 yuan ($7,331) transparent TV.</p>

<p>That said, Xiaomi will not be the first company to announce a 5G TV because another fellow Chinese company called ChiQ (Changhong) had already announced its offering earlier this year. However, we are not sure if this product is on sale in China.</p>

<p>Also, Xiaomi is yet to announce the launch date of its new 82-inch smart televisions in 4K and 8K resolution. Since they have been certified, they should be unveiled soon in the coming weeks.</p>
