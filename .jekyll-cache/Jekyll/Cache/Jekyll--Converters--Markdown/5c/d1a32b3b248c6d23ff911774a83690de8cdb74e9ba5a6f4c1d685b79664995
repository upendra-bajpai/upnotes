I"R<p>(WJW) — Eyes to the sky! There will be two full moons this October.</p>

<p>Normally, there is one full moon per month. But in 2020, October will have two full moons — one on Thursday, October 1 and then again on Halloween.</p>

<p>According to NASA, the rare phenomenon is called a blue moon.</p>

<p>Despite the name, the blue moon will not actually appear blue in color. In fact, a blue moon does not look any different than a regular, monthly full moon.</p>

<p>NASA says a blue moon usually only occurs every two-and-a-half years. The last blue moon appeared on March 31, 2018.</p>

<p>The term blue moon has been used to describe the second full moon in a calendar month since the 1940s. It inspired the phrase “once in a blue moon…”</p>

<p>In recent years people have been using the term “blue moon” to refer to another type of moon, EarthSky reports.</p>

<p>The term can also describe the third of four full moons in a single season — between a solstice and equinox. This is known as a seasonal blue moon.</p>

<p>The next seasonal Blue Moon will occur on August 22, 2021.</p>
