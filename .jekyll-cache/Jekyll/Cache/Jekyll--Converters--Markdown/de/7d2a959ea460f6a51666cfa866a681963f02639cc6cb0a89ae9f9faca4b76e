<p>Apple Event</p>

<p>In August, Apple apparently leaked a Sept. 10 event date on its YouTube channel. But recent invitations sent out by the company confirms that it‚Äôs holding an online event that‚Äôs actually scheduled for Sept. 15. During this presser, we expect Apple to focus on the next Apple Watch Series 6 and new iPads, instead of the new iPhone 12, 12 Pro and 12 Max (Apple has not confirmed the names of the phones, but we‚Äôll go with those for now).</p>

<p>That‚Äôs because while we usually see new flagship iPhones in September, the COVID-19 outbreak has forced suppliers in China to shut down or operate on limited capacity. This affected not only Apple‚Äôs inventory in September, but it may affect sales, too. Apple also closed its US retail stores, though now some have reopened in limited ways. All this culminated with Apple confirming there will be a delay on the iPhone 11 sequels, perhaps as late as October. Our best educated guess for the iPhone 12 announcement is either Oct. 13 or 14.</p>

<p>Now playing: Watch this: Will the iPhone 12 arrive on time?</p>

<p>Despite such disruptions and Apple‚Äôs veil of secrecy, there are some things we do know about the iPhone 12. From what we‚Äôve seen of iOS 14 and its public beta so far, we can expect the phone to have software features like widgets, app libraries and picture-in-picture. Unofficial hardware rumors include 3D depth sensing on its rear cameras and new screen sizes. Adding 5G connectivity would also make sense considering Apple‚Äôs main opponent, Samsung, launched several 5G phones this year, including the recent Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra, as well as the flagship Galaxy S20 phones. The later timeline might have some unexpected positive consequences too, including giving carriers like Verizon more time to build out its 5G coverage.</p>

<p>Until any of that happens though, check back often as we will continue to update it with the most probable and compelling rumors. And if you‚Äôre already planning to get the device, here are three things you can do now to prep for the iPhone 12.</p>

<p>Top iPhone 12 rumors</p>

<p>Apple said the iPhone 12 will be available ‚Äúa few weeks later‚Äù than the usual mid-September launch. An October release date is possible.</p>

<p>There may be four iPhone 12 models in three different screen sizes: the iPhone 12 (5.4-inch), 12 Max (6.1-inch), 12 Pro (6.1-inch) and 12 Pro Max (6.7-inch).</p>

<p>iPhone 12 base model may be cheaper than the iPhone 11‚Äôs $699 starting price.</p>

<p>iPhone 12 phones may have 5G.</p>

<p>iPhone 12 may not come with earbuds or a power adapter.</p>

<p>iPhone 12 may come in dark blue.</p>

<p>iPhone 12‚Äôs rear-facing camera(s) may have 3D depth-sensing technology.</p>

<p>Announcement date: Possibly October</p>

<p>In what appeared to be a misstep on Apple‚Äôs part, a Twitter user posted a screenshot of a possible Apple livestream event scheduled for Sept. 10. The event date and time appeared on Apple‚Äôs YouTube page and then was taken down.</p>

<p>We now know, however, that Apple is holding an event on Sept. 15, and it most likely won‚Äôt be about the iPhone. This still leaves the date of the iPhone 12 announcement up in the air. Another mobile leaker and Front Page Tech host Jon Prosser reported that the iPhone 12 will be introduced during an Oct. 12 event and will ship out Oct. 19, for instance.</p>

<p>Apple</p>

<p>Release date: iPhone 12 may not ship out until October</p>

<p>Despite Apple‚Äôs largest manufacturer, Foxconn, assuring investors it should still make its fall timeline, The Wall Street Journal reported that the iPhone 12 could face delays. This is due to the coronavirus pandemic and its unprecedented effect on manufacturing and consumer demands. The report estimated that Apple may wait until October to announce or launch the phone, which is about a month after the iPhone‚Äôs usual launch.</p>

<p>Apple CFO Luca Maestri all but confirmed this on a quarterly earnings call, saying, ‚ÄúThis year, we project supply to be available a few weeks later‚Äù than last year‚Äôs mid-September launch.</p>

<p>Others have suggested not a single launch date but several. A rumor floated by DigiTimes and picked up by MacRumors, suggested that Apple may launch its 2020 iPhones in multiple stages. The two 6.1-inch iPhone models may launch first, with the 6.7- and 5.4-inch variants coming later. (For more on the different speculated iPhone sizes, read more below.)</p>

<p>Price: iPhone 12 may be cheaper than iPhone 11</p>

<p>When the iPhone 11 debuted last year, we were pleasantly surprised that its base model cost $699, which was $50 cheaper than 2018‚Äôs iPhone XR. This trend may continue, with one tech analyst reporting that Apple will price the iPhone 12 at $649, the iPhone 12 Pro at $999 and the iPhone 12 Pro Max at $1,099.</p>

<p>5G: iPhone 12 may have next-gen connectivity</p>

<p>Several rumors are predicting that Apple will include 5G connectivity this year. More specifically, Apple analyst Ming-chi Kuo expects the company to unveil three 5G phones, and Fast Company reported that Apple may use its own proprietary 5G antennas.</p>

<p>There are a couple of reasons why the company didn‚Äôt jump on the trend in 2019. First, Apple usually isn‚Äôt the first in on mobile trends, preferring instead to perfect an emerging technology before committing to it. For example, it was behind its competitors in making phones with 3G and 4G LTE connectivity when those networks just launched.</p>

<p>Second, Apple stopped working with the leading 5G modem provider, Qualcomm, because of a dispute over Qualcomm‚Äôs licensing fees. The two companies settled their litigation in April 2019, and then agreed to a multiyear 5G chip deal. This led to Apple‚Äôs previous partner of 5G modems, Intel, to ultimately exit the 5G phone modem business altogether and Apple later acquired Intel‚Äôs smartphone modem business for $1 billion. Apple is still working with Qualcomm, but it got started too late to launch a 5G phone last year when a few of its rivals released their 5G models, like the Galaxy S10 5G, LG V50 5G and OnePlus 7 Pro 5G.</p>

<p>Whatever its start date though, Apple releasing a 5G phone is notable not only because the phone will be able to connect to the next-gen network, but also because this standout feature won‚Äôt be entirely under Apple‚Äôs control. 5G networks are built by carriers and Apple is taking a risk because users all across the country will have different experiences on this nascent network depending on their coverage.</p>

<p>Design: iPhone 12 may be similar (or not) to iPhone 11</p>

<p>Every other year, Apple usually makes notable cosmetic changes to its iPhone to freshen up its look, much to the delight of anticipating buyers. But a report by Japanese publication Mac Otakara, citing an unnamed Chinese supplier, reported that the iPhone 12 will look similar to the iPhone 11. The only possible difference is that the iPhone 12‚Äôs edges will be slightly bowed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Apple is also speculated to completely revamp the iPhone‚Äôs design with flat edges (similar to the new iPads). This could trigger what Wedbush analyst Dan Ives called ‚Äúthe perfect storm of demand,‚Äù which would drive up sales and result in a ‚Äúsuper cycle‚Äù for Apple.</p>

<p>Accessories: iPhone 12 may not come with EarPods or a power adapter</p>

<p>In one of the more unpopular rumors, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported that Apple may not include its wired EarPod headphones in the iPhone 12 box. This would be a move to encourage people to buy the company‚Äôs wireless AirPods instead. Apple has included EarPod headphones since the iPhone 5 release in 2012, so this would be a notable change. AirPod and AirPod Pro earbuds are currently priced at $159 (¬£159, AU$249) and $249 (¬£249, AU$399), respectively.</p>

<p>Angela Lang/CNET</p>

<p>Ming-Chi Kuo expects that the iPhone 12 will ship without a power adapter as well, according to 9to5Mac. The reason is mainly for costs ‚Äì by foregoing it, Apple can keep costs down while loading the phone with 5G components. It would also help lower freight costs as the size of the packaging would shrink.</p>

<p>Apple wouldn‚Äôt be alone in the change. Samsung‚Äôs Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra also don‚Äôt come with headphones ‚Äì though if you really need a pair, Samsung will send them for free. But unlike the power adapter rumor, the Note phones still come with a charger in the box.</p>

<p>Processor: iPhone 12 will likely have A14 Bionic</p>

<p>Given that the latest iPhones have the A13 Bionic processor, it is highly probable that the next proprietary chipset will be called the A14 Bionic. And like every year, we expect this one to be faster and more efficient than its predecessor. More specifically however, one Apple leaker on Twitter, Komiya, reported that the A14 will have a CPU gain of 40% and a GPU gain of 50%.</p>

<p>Colors: iPhone 12 Pro may come in dark blue</p>

<p>Last year Apple introduced a midnight green color on the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max. Whether you like the shade or not, the color variant actually sold well compared to expectations. This year there may be a possibility that Apple will launch another new color, navy blue, on the iPhone 12 Pro according to XDA Developer. This would be on trend since blue is both Pantone‚Äôs color pick for the new year (‚Äúclassic blue‚Äù) and Shutterstock included ‚Äúphantom blue‚Äù in its color forecast for 2020.</p>

<p>Specs and display: Four possible iPhone 12 models</p>

<p>One of the more enduring rumors about the upcoming iPhones is that Apple may introduce new screen sizes. One of the iPhone 12s could have a 5.4-inch screen (of the current iPhones, the new iPhone SE has the smallest display, which measures 4.7 inches). And the iPhone 2020 Pro Max could go as large as 6.7 inches (for reference, the iPhone 11 Pro Max has a 6.5-inch display).</p>

<p>There‚Äôs also speculation that the iPhone 12‚Äôs display will have a 120Hz refresh rate and that perhaps the iPhone 12 Pro may have a ProMotion display, which is currently featured on the iPad Pro. Most phones refresh at 60 frames per second, or 60Hz, but other phones, like the Galaxy S20 and the OnePlus 8 Pro refresh at 120Hz. With a higher refresh rate, a phone feels faster and smoother when scrolling through things like web pages and apps.</p>

<p>Phone Arena</p>

<p>With the possibility of new display sizes, rumors that Apple will expand its iPhone line have been swirling around. In December 2019, CNET‚Äôs Lexy Savvides wrote:</p>

<p>According to JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee, Apple will release four new iPhone 12 models in the fall of 2020: a 5.4-inch model, two 6.1-inch phones and a 6.7-inch phone. All of them will have OLED displays. These size predictions were also backed this week by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who believes the current 5.8-inch size of the iPhone 11 Pro may be going away. So the 5.4-inch and one of the 6.1-inch models will be the lower-end devices, presumably called the iPhone 12. Then the more expensive phones will be the other 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, respectively.</p>

<p>Camera: iPhone 12 may have 3D depth sensing</p>

<p>Since the iPhone X, newer iPhones have front-facing cameras that have 3D depth sensing. Known as Face ID, this feature scans your face for unlocking your phone and authorizing digital payments. It‚Äôs been rumored that Apple may take it up a notch and introduce that same system to the rear cameras. In August 2019, CNET‚Äôs Vanessa Orellana wrote:</p>

<p>Longtime Apple analyst Ming Chi Kuo (via MacRumors and 9to5Mac) said he expects two of the 2020 iPhones models to have a new time-of-flight camera lens on the back of the phone. The setup would be similar to that of the current True Depth camera system used for Face ID on the front of the phone, except it would use a slightly different type of technology that could allow it to 3D map objects from farther away. This would significantly improve its augmented reality applications and take certain camera features like Portrait Mode to the next level.</p>

<p>Renders of the iPhone‚Äôs camera array integrating the depth-sensing lens have been circulating, with many online commenters remarking how the iPhone 12‚Äôs possible camera layout looks similar to a stovetop.</p>
