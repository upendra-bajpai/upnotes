I"e<p>Whatâ€™s up guys and welcome to todayâ€™s video where I will be sharing with you 5 awesome apps you can use to edit videos on your phone professionally. without much ado, letâ€™s get into it.</p>

<p>Power Director</p>

<p>The first app on the list is Power Director. this is one of the popular video editing apps and I can boldly say the best on Playstore. This app offers lots of features to make your video editing as seamless as possibleâ€™</p>

<p>You can trim, rotate videos, control brightness, colour, saturation, and video temperature. Animated texts ad titles can also be added to give your video that professional look.</p>

<p>You can choose from the numerous filters available to give your video a nice colour grade</p>

<p>If your video is not stabilized, the app offers a feature to help with that. There are lots of transitions to also choose from and the good thing is, you get to preview them before applying them to your video. Once youâ€™re done editing, you can export in 720p or upgrade to pro to be able to export in 1080p or 4k. The pro feature also comes with lots of stock videos and photos you can use in your videos</p>

<p>Filmorago</p>

<p>Filmorago is one of the simplest video editing apps because it features a very simple UI that makes the app easy and fun to use. You can easily trim or split your videos, add and control music volume, add titles and text, and more. The app also allows you to bring life to your video by adding stickers, filters, and other effects.</p>

<p>Filmorago also offers some smooth transitions and also gives you full control over them by letting you decide its duration. the free version only supports exports in 360p, 480p, and 720p. you have to upgrade to be able to export in 1080p and also remove the filmorago watermark.</p>

<p>KineMaster</p>

<p>The next video editing app u should try is Kinemaster. Just like its predecessors, this app offers some simple features u can use in editing your videos. Some of its key features include the ability to combine different layers of photos, videos, text, and other effects. There are also tools you can use to adjust colour and enhance the overall look and feel of your video. the app also allows u to add music or even record a voice over for your project. Exports can be done in your preferred resolution, frame rate, and bitrate. higher resolutions come at a cost.</p>

<p>Quik</p>

<p>Just as the name implies, Quik is a video editing app for creating short and easy video montages for social media. It offers a variety of video styles to get you started. you can add transitions, graphics, and filters within minutes.</p>

<p>There is the option to add custom text and even emojis to your video. The app also has a music library with lots of music you can use for your video and if you donâ€™t like any, you can upload your own music. Once you are done editing, u can save the video on your phone and post it on social media.</p>

<p>Pixel Flow</p>

<p>When youâ€™re done editing your video and want some cool titles to complete it, then get pixel flow. this appâ€™s main purpose is to provide you with lots of title animations for your video. these animations can be previewed before adding them to your videos.</p>

<p>You can choose titles based on the theme of your video. There are gaming titles for gaming videos, cooking titles for cooking videos, sports, tech, and more. u can stick with the free version and still get some cool titles to work with but if you want more options, then you can upgrade to pro.</p>
