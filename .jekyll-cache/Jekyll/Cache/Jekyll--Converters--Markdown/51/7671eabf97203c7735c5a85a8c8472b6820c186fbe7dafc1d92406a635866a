I"Ó<p>Chuwi Hi10X tablet - $249.99 from Banggood</p>

<p>(Â£198.52/AU$350.09)</p>

<p>This Chuwi tablet is the best alternative to Microsoftâ€™s Surface Go on the market - and itâ€™ll cost you far less. With an Intel Gemini Lake 4100 processor and 6GB of RAM, the Hi10X tablet can do everything its rival can and more.View Deal</p>

<p>The Chuwi Hi10x is, in our opinion, the best alternative to Microsoftâ€™s Surface Go 2 - the recently released Windows-based tablet that goes head-to-head against the iPad with its 10.5-inch form factor.</p>

<p>The follow-up to the Chuwi Hi10 is a huge improvement on the original, which we reviewed it back in 2016, and makes for an enticing proposition indeed.</p>

<p>Including a capacitive stylus pen and original keyboard docking station, the Hi10X comes in at under $250 (Â£200/AU$350), which is still far lower than the 64GB version of the Surface Go 2 (which, as a reminder, comes without additional accessories).</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve built a list of the best rugged tablets available</p>

<p>For your money, you get a Gemini Lake-based Intel Celeron N4100 that is significantly faster than the Surface Goâ€™s Pentium 4415Y (based on CPUBenchmark and Geekbench numbers).</p>

<p>The Hi10X also features a 10.1-inch Full HD display, 6GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD - twice the storage capacity of the Microsoftâ€™s cheapest tablet. Using the keyboard dock makes the device thicker, but also provides two USB ports.</p>

<p>The Surface Go has a larger display size but a more petite footprint, which means the Chuwi device is slightly heavier. The camera sensors on Microsoftâ€™s tablet also have a higher resolution, but the Hi10X has more connectors - including an HDMI port, which means you wonâ€™t need a docking station to connect up to a monitor.</p>
