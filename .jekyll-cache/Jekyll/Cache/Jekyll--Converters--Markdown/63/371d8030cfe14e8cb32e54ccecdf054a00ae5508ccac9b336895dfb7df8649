<p>where p is parallel part of program Given, sequential part of program is 5%. So parallel part of the program (P)</p>

<p>= 1 - sequential part
= 1 - 0.05 (or 5%)
= 0.95 (or 95%)</p>

<p>Now S = 1 / (1-P)
ie  S = 1 / (1-0.95)
    S = 1 / 0.05
    S = 20</p>

   time

<p>Which of the above can cause a hazard ?
(A) 1 and 2 only
(B) 2 and 3 only
(C) 3 only
(D) All of above</p>

<h3 id="answer-d">Answer: (D)</h3>

<p>Explanation: Case 1: Is of data dependency .this can’t be safe with single ALU so read after write.</p>

<p>Case 2:Conditional jumps are always hazardous they create conditional dependency in pipeline.</p>

<p>Case 3:This is write after read problem or concurrency dependency so hazardous</p>

<p>All the three are hazardous</p>

<p>The size of micro-instruction is:
a.17
b.20
C.24
D.32
Microprocessor instruction format, which is divided into three subfields F1, F2, F3 each having seven distinct micro-operations, condition field CD for four status bits, branch field BR having four options used in conjunction with address field ADF. The address space is of 128 memory locations.ie: q8 F1,F2,F3 each having seven distinct micro-operation. So, 3 bits are required for each. Condition field have four status, it needs 2 bits for four different condition. Branch field have four option so,it needs 2 bits for four option. Now there are 128 different memory location, So, there 7 bits atre required for 128 diffeent location. Instruction Field: q8 (1) Total bits are 20. So, option (B) is correct.</p>

The number of rows of memory cells in the DRAM chip is 214. The time taken to perform one refresh operation is 50 nanoseconds. The refresh period is 2 milliseconds. The percentage (rounded to the closet integer) of the time available for performing the memory read/write operations in the main memory unit is <strong>__</strong>_</h5>

<p>Given, total number of rows is 214 and time taken to perform one refresh operation is 50 nanoseconds. So, total time taken to perform refresh operation = 214*50 nanoseconds = 819200 nanoseconds = 0.819200 milliseconds. But refresh period is 2 milliseconds. So, time spent in refresh period in percentage = (0.819200 milliseconds) / (2 milliseconds) = 0.4096 = 40.96% Hence, time spent in read/write operation = 100% - 40.96% = 59.04% = 59 (in percentage and rounded to the closet integer). So, answer is 59.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The RISC design philosophy generally incorporates a larger number of registers to prevent in large amounts of interactions with memory.
The decision of RISC processor designers to provide simple addressing modes leads to uniform length instructions, so RISC instruction is of uniform fixed length.
In the hardwired control unit, the control units use fixed logic circuits to interpret instructions and generate control signals from them. It is significantly faster than its counterpart but is rather inflexible. Most of the RISC processors are based on the hardwired control unit design approach.
