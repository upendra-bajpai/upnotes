I"€	<p>We are mere days away from Nvidiaâ€™s release of its new Ampere-based GeForce RTX 3000-series graphics cards, and listings for the enormously powerful RTX 3090 have started to pop up on Amazon and Best Buy.</p>

<p>Versions of the GeForce RTX 3090 have been listed from EVGA and Gigabyte, offering â€˜aftermarketâ€™ takes on Nvidiaâ€™s own Founders Edition RTX 3090. These graphics cards pack in 10,496 CUDA cores and 24GB of GDDR6X memory under a triple-fan chassis, promising vast amounts of graphical power to drive next-generation games.</p>

<p>The graphical grunt the RTX 3090 is not only set to easily blow away the performance of Nvidiaâ€™s last high-end consumer graphics card, the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, but also offer far more power than the PS5 or Xbox Series X. However, that power will come at a hefty price.</p>

<p>We already know the Founders Edition RTX 3090 will go for $1,499, but third-party versions will be even more expensive, with the Gigabyte Eagle and Gigabyte Gaming versions listed at $1,549,99 and $1,579.99. And youâ€™ll want a pretty powerful PC to take advantage of all the GPU power the new Ampere architecture offers, which means building an RTX 3090 gaming PC will likely cost north of $2,000.</p>

<p>For the price of the graphics card alone, youâ€™ll be able to buy three $499 Xbox Series X consoles and still have a bit of cash to spare. PC gaming has always been expensive on a hardware front, but this is certainly a hefty price.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s also worth noting that Gigabyteâ€™s graphics cards are using air-based cooling. As such, aftermarket versions with fancier cooling systems, such as water cooling systems, will likely cost even more.</p>

<p>The EVGA GeForce RTX 3090 Kingpin, for example, comes with a twin-fan radiator, and the also sports a water cooling system. The cardâ€™s price has yet to be revealed but expect it to be eye-wateringly expensive.</p>

<p>But if youâ€™re after the very best tech gaming can offer and want a PC over a next-generation console, then the GeForce RTX 3090 is the way to go. It will deliver 4K resolution, 60 frames per second gaming, with ray-tracing enabled. And in some cases it promising to offer 8K gaming.</p>

<p>This makes it a fantastically powerful and expensive bit of gaming hardware. But it should deliver performance that will take years for other graphics cards and gaming tech to catch up with.</p>
