I"ÿ<p>Samsung had first deployed the September 2020 security patch last week, with the Galaxy Note 9 being the first device in its portfolio to receive it. A handful of other devices have followed suit, including the Galaxy Note 10 Lite which also received One UI 2.5. As the rollout continues to expand, the company has now briefly turned its attention towards one of its older S Pen models, namely the Galaxy Note 8.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Note 8 carrying model number SM-N950F is presently receiving the September 2020 security update in Nordic countries. As always, the updateâ€™s availability will expand to other regions in the coming days and weeks, so donâ€™t feel left out if you have yet to received the update notification on your phone. The rollout process is gradual but it will eventually reach every one of the millions of Galaxy Note 8 units that have been sold by Samsung over the years.</p>

<p>The latest update for the Galaxy Note 8 can be identified by firmware version N950FXXUDDTH1 and, as expected, it doesnâ€™t seem to bring any new features to the aging S Pen device. In addition, Samsung has yet to detail the September 2020 security patch so itâ€™s unclear what vulnerabilities itâ€™s supposed to fix. Regardless, higher security is always welcomed and you should update your Galaxy Note 8 as soon as you have the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>If you reside in Nordic countries, you can try to trigger the update process by opening Settings on your phone, accessing Software update, and tapping Download and install. If you reside elsewhere, keep an eye out for new update notifications on your phone. Alternatively, you can refer to SamMobileâ€™s firmware archives, download the latest Galaxy Note 8 firmware on your Windows PC and flash it to your phone manually.</p>
