I"ç<p>After a lot of wait and leaks, Apple has gone ahead and sent out invites for its September event that‚Äôs scheduled for the 15th of the month. However, unlike previous September events where we see the new iPhones, this September event is going to be slightly different.</p>

<p>The event invite has the Apple logo that looks doodled by hand, followed by the text Time Flies. This signifies that the event is going to be surrounding Apple Watch and the iPad. This basically means that we won‚Äôt be seeing an iPhone at this event.</p>

<p>This isn‚Äôt surprising, since several reports in the past have indicated that the new iPhone 12‚Äôs are going to be delayed due to the novel coronavirus and is expected to hit the shelves sometime in October.</p>

<p>Moreover, since this year we‚Äôre going to see so many different iterations of the iPhone 12‚Äôs, perhaps Apple has something special planned for that event.</p>

<p>Now, coming to the devices Apple could launch at this event. We could expect a successor to the 2019 iPad Air with a considerably faster CPU and hopefully a display with thinner bezels than the previous version ‚Äì this is something the leaks that spotted new iPad variants at the EEC have shed some light on too. We could also expect the new iPads to support the second-generation Apple Pencil with support for wireless charging.</p>

<p>Coming to the Apple Watch, we can hope that the Series 6 could get a better, higher quality display, in a lighter, and sleeker body along with a newer processor that not only offers better performance but also consumes less battery.</p>

<p>The event is expected to commence at 10:00 AM PDT which is around 10:30 PM IST. In case you‚Äôre interested in watching this you‚Äôll need to head to Apple‚Äôs website here to watch the live stream.</p>
