<p>Recently, C Manmohan, Poco India General Manager, hinted on Twitter that the phone may be launched for Rs. 20,000 + taxes in India.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Roy claims that the Indian variant will have a slightly bigger battery than the one in the global variant. The Poco X3 NFC global variant packs a 5,160mAh battery.</p>

<p>This development comes a week after another tipster Mukul Sharma tweeted that the Poco X3 India model will launch in an 8GB variant as well. Sharma pointed at the alleged Geekbench listing of Xiaomi M2007J20CI that tipster claims to be of the Poco X3.</p>

<p>This particular phone is seen packing an 8GB RAM and Android 10. The listing also shows that the phone is powered by a â€˜karnaâ€™ processor that could be the codename for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 732G SoC - the same chipset that powers the Poco X3 NFC. It could be possible that the Indian variant could get a different set of specifications.</p>
